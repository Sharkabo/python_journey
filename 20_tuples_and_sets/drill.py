# Drills - Unit 20: Tuples & Sets
# ---------------------------------

# Drill 1: Create a tuple called point with values (5, 10) and print it


# Drill 2: Unpack the tuple: x, y = point, then print x and y separately


# Drill 3: Create a set called numbers with values {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3} and print it (notice duplicates removed)


# Drill 4: Add the number 4 to the numbers set using .add(), then print the set


# Drill 5: Create two sets: a = {1, 2, 3} and b = {3, 4, 5}, then print their intersection using a & b
