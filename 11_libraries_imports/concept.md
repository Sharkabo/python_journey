# Unit 11: Libraries & Imports

## 1. Using Modules
Python comes with batteries included! You don't have to write everything yourself.
We use `import` to load ready-made tools.

**Example (Random):**
```python
import random

number = random.randint(1, 10) # Random number between 1 and 10
print(number)
```

**Example (Math):**
```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16)) # Square root: 4.0
```

## Spiral Learning Note
Remember Unit 02 (Math) and Unit 08 (Game)? Now we can make the game fun with REAL random numbers instead of a fixed secret number!
