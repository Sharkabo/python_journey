# Drills - Unit 12: Try/Except
# ----------------------------

# Drill 1: Write a try block: try to print int("Hello") (which causes an error)


# Drill 2: Add an except ValueError block that prints "Cannot convert text to number"


# Drill 3: Write a try block: try to do 10 / 0


# Drill 4: Add an except ZeroDivisionError block that prints "Cannot divide by zero"


# Drill 5: Write a simple try/except that catches ANY error (except Exception:) and prints "Oops"
