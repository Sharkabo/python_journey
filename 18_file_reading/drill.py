# Drills - Unit 18: File Reading
# ------------------------------

# Drill 1: (Assume test.txt exists) Open "test.txt" with `with open("test.txt", "r") as f:`, read content with f.read(), and print it


# Drill 2: Write a try block that tries to open a non-existent file, and an except block that prints "File not found"
