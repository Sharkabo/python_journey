# Drill 1: Write a try block that prints int("Hello"), and an except ValueError that prints "Cannot convert text to number"


# Drill 2: Write a try block that does 10 / 0, and an except ZeroDivisionError that prints "Cannot divide by zero"


# Drill 3: Write a simple try/except that catches ANY error (except Exception:) and prints "Oops"
