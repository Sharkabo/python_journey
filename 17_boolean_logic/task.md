# Task: Access Control System

Open `answer.py` in this folder and complete the following objectives:

## Goal 1: Get User Information
Ask the user for their age (convert to int) and ask if they have a membership card (yes/no).

## Goal 2: Check Access Rules
A person can enter if:
- They are 18 or older AND have a membership card, OR
- They are 65 or older (senior citizens get free entry)

## Goal 3: Display Result
Use boolean logic to check the conditions and print either:
- "Access Granted! Welcome!" 
- "Access Denied. Requirements not met."

---
**Expected Output:**
Example 1 (age=25, card=yes):
```text
Enter your age: 25
Do you have a membership card? (yes/no): yes
Access Granted! Welcome!
```

Example 2 (age=16, card=no):
```text
Enter your age: 16
Do you have a membership card? (yes/no): no
Access Denied. Requirements not met.
```
