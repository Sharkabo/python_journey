# Python Journey - Phase System Guide

## Overview

This project uses a **multi-phase learning system** that takes you from Python basics to FastAPI backend engineer, divided into 7 clear phases.

Each phase has:
- Independent directory
- Independent unit numbering (starting from 01)
- Independent CURRICULUM.md file

## Phase 0: Python Basics (Completed)

**Path**: `PHASE_0_PYTHON_BASICS/`
**Units**: 21 units (01-21)
**Status**: Completed

### Learning Content
- Python basic syntax (variables, numbers, strings)
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Data structures (lists, dicts, tuples, sets)
- Function definition and usage
- File I/O operations
- Error handling (try/except)
- List comprehensions

### Completion Criteria
You have completed all 21 units in PHASE_0_CURRICULUM.md.

## Phase 1: Advanced Python (Current Phase)

**Path**: `PHASE_1_ADVANCED_PYTHON/`
**Units**: 16 units (01-16)
**Estimated Time**: 3-6 weeks

### Learning Objectives
- Master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Understand decorators and type hints (FastAPI essentials)
- Learn generators, iterators, context managers
- Implement basic data structures (linked lists, trees)
- Practice common algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Build custom exception hierarchies

### Why is this important?
- OOP is the foundation of all web frameworks
- Type Hints are FastAPI's core feature
- Decorators are used in FastAPI routing
- Data structures & algorithms are required for technical interviews

### Start Learning
Enter `PHASE_1_ADVANCED_PYTHON/01_oop_classes_objects/` to begin.

- async/await asynchronous programming
- Complete Blog API project

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 months

---

## Phase 4: DevOps & Deployment (Future)

**Planned Content**:
- Advanced Git operations
- Docker containerization
- Docker Compose
- GCP Cloud Run deployment
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Monitoring and logging

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 months

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Skills (Future)

**Planned Content**:
- Redis caching
- Celery async tasks

## How to Use This Structure

### 1. Focus on One Phase at a Time
Don't skip phases. Each phase builds on the previous one.

### 2. Complete All Parts of Each Unit
- Read `concept.md` (theory)
- Complete `drill.py` (basic practice)
- Complete task in `task.md` (implementation)
- Write your answer in `my_answer.py`

### 3. Use YouTube for Supplementary Learning
Each `concept.md` has YouTube keyword recommendations and channels. Search for videos if text learning is difficult.

### 4. Track Your Progress
In each phase's CURRICULUM.md, mark the units you've completed.

### 5. Don't Rush
- Full-time learning: Expected 7-9 months to complete all phases
- Part-time learning: Expected 10-12 months
- Casual learning: Expected 15-18 months

---

## Current Status

- PHASE_0: Completed (21 units)
- PHASE_1: In Progress (16 units)
- PHASE_2-6: Pending creation

**Your Next Step**: Start PHASE_1 Unit 01 - Classes and Objects

---

## Templates

All phases share the `_templates/` folder:
- `concept.md` - Concept explanation template
- `task.md` - Task description template
- `drill.py` - Practice exercises template
- `answer.py` - Reference answer template (optional)

---

## Getting Help

If you encounter problems while learning:
1. Check the YouTube recommendations in that unit's `concept.md`
2. Search Stack Overflow
3. Join Python Taiwan Facebook group
4. Refer to PYTHON_WEB_CAREER_ROADMAP.md for learning resources
