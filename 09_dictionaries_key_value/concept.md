# Unit 09: Dictionaries (Key-Value)

## 1. What is a Dictionary?
Lists (Unit 05) use numbers (indexes) to find things.
**Dictionaries** use words (Keys) to find things (Values). It's like a real dictionary.

**Syntax:**
```python
person = {
    "name": "Ian",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

## 2. Accessing Data
We use the "Key" inside square brackets.

**Example:**
```python
print(person["name"]) # Prints: Ian
print(person["age"])  # Prints: 30
```

We are upgrading our storage! Variables (Unit 01) hold one thing. Lists (Unit 05) hold a list of things. Dictionaries hold structured data describing one complex thing.
