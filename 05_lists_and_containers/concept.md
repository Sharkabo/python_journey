# Unit 05: Lists & Containers

## 1. What is a List?
Variables hold one thing (Unit 01). **Lists** hold many things in order.
Think of a **Shopping List**: You have one piece of paper (the list), but it has many items written on it.

We use square brackets `[]` to create a list.

**Example:**
```python
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
```

## 2. Accessing Items
We use the **Index** to get an item. Computers start counting at **0**.
- `fruits[0]` is "Apple"
- `fruits[1]` is "Banana"

## 3. Adding Items
Use `.append()` to add to the end of a list.

**Example:**
```python
fruits.append("Orange")
print(fruits)
```

## Spiral Learning Note
Lists are powerful variable containers. We can store user inputs (Unit 03) into a list to save a history of what they typed!
