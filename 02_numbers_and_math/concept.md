# Unit 02: Numbers & Math

## 1. Numbers (Integers and Floats)
Unlike text (Strings), numbers don't need quotes.
- **Integer (`int`)**: Whole numbers (e.g., 5, -10)
- **Float (`float`)**: Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.01)

**Think back to Unit 01:**
Just like `name = "Ian"`, we use variables to store numbers. The only difference is we **don't** use quotes for numbers.

```python
age = 25       # Integer
height = 1.75  # Float
name = "Ian"   # String (Needs quotes)
```

## 2. Basic Math
You can do math with numbers just like on a calculator.

**Syntax:**
- `+` (Add)
- `-` (Subtract)
- `*` (Multiply)
- `/` (Divide)

**Example:**
```python
x = 10
y = 5
result = x * y
print(result) # Prints 50
```

## Spiral Learning Note
In Unit 01, we printed text. Now we calculate numbers. In the next unit, we will combine these to ask the user for numbers and calculate them!
