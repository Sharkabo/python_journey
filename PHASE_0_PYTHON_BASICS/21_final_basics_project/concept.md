# Unit 21: Final Basics Project

## 1. Challenge: The Journal
Combine everything you learned in Units 01-21 to build a complete application.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Loop** (Unit 15): Keep the program running until the user types "exit".
2.  **Input** (Unit 03): Ask the user to write a journal entry.
3.  **File Appending** (Unit 19): Save that entry to `journal.txt` using append mode (`"a"`).
4.  **Date** (Unit 16): (Optional) Add the current date to the entry.
