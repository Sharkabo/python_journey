# Unit 01: Print & Variables

Welcome to your first Python lesson! We will keep it light and focus on just two core concepts.

## 1. Print
The most basic function of a program is to "talk" to you. In Python, we use the `print()` command to display text on the screen.

**Syntax:**
```python
print("Put your text here")
```

**Example:**
```python
print("Hello World")
print("I am learning Python")
```
*Note: Text must be wrapped in single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ".*

## 2. Variables
Imagine a variable is a **Label Sticker** that you put on a box containing data.
This allows us to refer to the data by its "Label Name" later, without retyping the content every time.

**Syntax:**
```python
variable_name = "Content"
```

**Example:**
```python
my_hero = "Iron Man"
print(my_hero)
```
This code will print: `Iron Man`

## Spiral Learning Note
In this unit, we only learned how to store "Text" (Strings) in variables. Next time, we will learn how to store "Numbers" and do basic math with them.
