# Unit 04: Making Decisions (If/Else)

## 1. Conditions
We use `if` statements to run code ONLY if a condition is true.

**Comparison Operators:**
- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)

## 2. If, Else, Elif
- `if`: Starts the check.
- `elif` (Else If): Checks another condition if the first failed.
- `else`: Runs if NONE of the above were true.

**Example:**
```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade B")
else:
    print("Study harder")
```

## Spiral Learning Note
We can now make our programs smart! We can take `input` (Unit 03), convert it to a number (Unit 02), and check its value using `if`.
