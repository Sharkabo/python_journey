# Task: Build a Function Timing and Logging System

Open `answer.py` in this folder and complete the following objectives:

## Goal 1: Create a Timing Decorator
Create a decorator that:
- Measures how long a function takes to execute
- Prints the execution time in seconds
- Works with any function

## Goal 2: Create a Logging Decorator
Create a decorator that:
- Prints when a function is called
- Shows the function name and arguments
- Prints when the function finishes

## Goal 3: Stack Multiple Decorators
Demonstrate:
- Applying both decorators to a function
- Understanding decorator execution order
- Testing with sample functions

**Expected Output:**
```text
Calling function: calculate
calculate took 0.50 seconds
Function finished: calculate
Result: 42
```
