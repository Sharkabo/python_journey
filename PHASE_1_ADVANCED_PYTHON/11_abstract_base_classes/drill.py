# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Import ABC and abstractmethod


# Drill 2: Create an abstract class Vehicle with abstract method start_engine()


# Drill 3: Create a concrete class Car that implements Vehicle


# Drill 4: Try to instantiate Vehicle directly (comment out - it will error)


# Drill 5: Create an ABC with both abstract and concrete methods


# Drill 6: Create an abstract property in an ABC


# Drill 7: Create a Shape ABC with abstract methods area() and perimeter()


# Drill 8: Implement Rectangle and Circle classes from Shape ABC


# Drill 9: Create an abstract class with @abstractmethod for __str__


# Drill 10: Create a repository pattern ABC (like UserRepository in concept.md)
