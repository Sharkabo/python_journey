# Task: Implement Linked List Operations

Open `answer.py` in this folder and complete the following objectives:

## Goal 1: Implement Insert Operations
Add these methods to LinkedList:
- `insert_at_beginning(data)`
- `insert_at_position(data, position)`
- Proper handling of edge cases

## Goal 2: Implement Delete Operations
Add these methods:
- `delete_by_value(value)` - removes first occurrence
- `delete_at_position(position)`
- Handle empty list and invalid positions

## Goal 3: Implement Search and Reverse
Add these methods:
- `search(value)` - returns True/False
- `reverse()` - reverses the entire list

---

**Expected Output:**
```text
Original: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> None
Inserted at beginning: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> None
Deleted 20: 5 -> 10 -> 30 -> None
Reversed: 30 -> 10 -> 5 -> None
```
