# Task: Implement Sorting Algorithms

Open `answer.py` in this folder and complete the following objectives:

## Goal 1: Implement Basic Sorting Algorithms
Implement from scratch:
- `bubble_sort(arr)` - O(n²)
- `selection_sort(arr)` - O(n²)
- `insertion_sort(arr)` - O(n²)

## Goal 2: Implement Advanced Sorting
Implement:
- `merge_sort(arr)` - O(n log n)
- Demonstrate divide-and-conquer approach
- Show efficiency improvement

## Goal 3: Compare Sorting Performance
Create benchmarks that:
- Test each algorithm with different array sizes
- Measure execution time
- Compare results

**Expected Output:**
```text
Array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

Bubble sort: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90] (15ms)
Selection sort: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90] (12ms)
Merge sort: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90] (3ms)
```
