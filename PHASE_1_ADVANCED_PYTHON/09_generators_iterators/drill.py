# Drills - Muscle Memory Training
# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Create a generator function called count_up(n) that yields numbers from 1 to n. Test it by iterating with a for loop.


# Drill 2: Create a generator expression that yields squares of numbers from 1 to 10. Assign it to a variable and print the first 5 values using next().


# Drill 3: Create a generator function called even_numbers(max_num) that yields only even numbers from 0 to max_num.


# Drill 4: Create a custom iterator class called RangeIterator that mimics Python's built-in range(). Implement __iter__() and __next__() methods.


# Drill 5: Create a generator function called fibonacci_gen() that yields Fibonacci numbers infinitely. Test it by printing the first 10 numbers.
