# Drills - Muscle Memory Training
# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Create a simple decorator called print_decorator that prints "Function is running" before executing the decorated function. Apply it to a function called say_hello() that prints "Hello".


# Drill 2: Create a decorator called double_result that takes a function returning a number and doubles the result before returning it. Apply it to a function add(a, b) that returns a + b.


# Drill 3: Modify the decorator from Drill 2 to properly handle *args and **kwargs, and use @wraps from functools to preserve function metadata.


# Drill 4: Create a decorator called count_calls that counts how many times a decorated function has been called. Use a nonlocal or global variable to keep track of the count. Print the count each time the function runs.


# Drill 5: Create a parametrized decorator called repeat(times) that executes the decorated function N times. For example, @repeat(3) should execute the function 3 times.
