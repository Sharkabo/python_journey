# Task: Build Data Processing Generators

Open `answer.py` in this folder and complete the following objectives:

## Goal 1: Create a Fibonacci Generator
Create a generator that:
- Yields Fibonacci numbers infinitely
- Uses yield keyword properly
- Is memory efficient

## Goal 2: Create a File Processing Generator
Create a generator that:
- Reads a large file line by line
- Filters lines based on criteria
- Demonstrates lazy evaluation

## Goal 3: Use Generator Expressions
Demonstrate:
- Generator expressions vs list comprehensions
- Memory efficiency benefits
- Chaining generators

**Expected Output:**
```text
Fibonacci: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...
Processing 1M lines with minimal memory
Filtered results: [matching lines]
```
