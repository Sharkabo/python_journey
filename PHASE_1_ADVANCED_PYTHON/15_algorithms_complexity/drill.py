# Drills - Muscle Memory Training
# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Implement linear_search(arr, target) that returns the index of target or -1. What is the time complexity?


# Drill 2: Implement binary_search(sorted_arr, target) that returns the index of target or -1. What is the time complexity?


# Drill 3: Implement bubble_sort(arr) that sorts the array in-place and returns it. What is the time complexity?


# Drill 4: Implement a function find_max(arr) that returns the maximum value in O(n) time.


# Drill 5: Implement two_sum(numbers, target) using a hash map that returns indices of two numbers that sum to target. What is the time and space complexity?
