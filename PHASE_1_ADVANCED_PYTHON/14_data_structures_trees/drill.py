# Drills - Muscle Memory Training
# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.

# Drill 1: Create a TreeNode class with __init__(data) that stores data, left (None), and right (None) attributes.


# Drill 2: Create a BinarySearchTree class with __init__ that sets root to None, and a method is_empty() that returns True if root is None.


# Drill 3: Add a method insert(data) to BinarySearchTree that inserts a value. If root is None, create a new root. Otherwise, use a helper method _insert_recursive(node, data) to find the correct position based on BST rules.


# Drill 4: Add a method search(data) to BinarySearchTree that returns True if the value exists. Use a helper method _search_recursive(node, data) to recursively search left or right based on value comparison.


# Drill 5: Add a method inorder_traversal() that returns a list of values in sorted order. Use a helper method _inorder_recursive(node, result) that visits left, appends data, then visits right.
