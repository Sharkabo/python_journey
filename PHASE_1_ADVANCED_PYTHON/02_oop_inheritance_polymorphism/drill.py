# Drill 1: Create a Vehicle parent class with __init__(brand, model) and a describe() method that returns a description string. Then create a Car child class that inherits from Vehicle.


# Drill 2: In the Car class from Drill 1, override the __init__ to accept brand, model, and num_doors. Use super().__init__() to call the parent's __init__, then add num_doors as a new attribute.


# Drill 3: Create a Calculator parent class with an add(a, b) method. Create a ScientificCalculator child class that inherits from Calculator and adds a power(base, exponent) method.


# Drill 4: Create a Bird parent class with a move() method that returns "Flying". Create two child classes: Penguin (override move to return "Swimming") and Eagle (keep the inherited move method).


# Drill 5: Create a function called describe_animal(animal) that takes any animal object and calls its make_sound() method. Test it with at least two different animal types that have different make_sound() implementations (demonstrating polymorphism).
