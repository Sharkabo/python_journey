# Drills - Muscle Memory Training
# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Create a class called Person with a protected attribute _age (set in __init__). Create a method get_age() that returns the age.


# Drill 2: Modify the Person class from Drill 1 to use @property decorator for age instead of get_age(). The property should return self._age.


# Drill 3: Add a setter to the age property from Drill 2 that validates the age is between 0 and 150. Raise a ValueError if invalid.


# Drill 4: Create a Rectangle class with _width and _height as protected attributes. Add @property for both width and height with setters that ensure values are positive.


# Drill 5: Add a read-only @property called area to the Rectangle class that computes and returns width * height (no setter needed).
