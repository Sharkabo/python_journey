# Drills - Muscle Memory Training
# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Create a Node class with __init__(data) that stores data and a next pointer (initially None).


# Drill 2: Create a LinkedList class with an __init__ method that sets head to None, and a method is_empty() that returns True if head is None.


# Drill 3: Add a method insert_at_beginning(data) to LinkedList that creates a new node and makes it the new head.


# Drill 4: Add a method print_list() to LinkedList that traverses the list and prints all data values separated by " -> " ending with "None".


# Drill 5: Add a method insert_at_end(data) to LinkedList that traverses to the last node and adds a new node at the end.
