# Capstone Project Implementation
"""
Create your task management system here.

Recommended Structure:
Create these files in an 'answer/' subdirectory:
- models.py - Task class, enums, and data models
- manager.py - TaskManager with business logic
- decorators.py - Custom decorators
- utils.py - Helper functions
- main.py - Main entry point with menu
- tasks.json - Data storage (auto-generated)

Getting Started:
1. Create the answer/ directory
2. Implement models first (Task, enums)
3. Build TaskManager with basic CRUD
4. Add file persistence
5. Create the menu system
6. Test and refine

Good luck! This is the culmination of all your Phase 1 learning.
