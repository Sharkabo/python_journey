# Capstone Project Preparation Drills
# These drills will help you prepare for the capstone project.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Create a simple enum for TaskStatus with values: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED. Use Python's enum module.


# Drill 2: Create a Task class with __init__(title, description, priority) and a __str__ method that returns a formatted string representation.


# Drill 3: Create a decorator called log_operation that prints "Executing: [function_name]" before calling the function. Apply it to a sample function.


# Drill 4: Write a function save_to_json(data, filename) that uses a context manager to safely write dictionary data to a JSON file.


# Drill 5: Write a function sort_tasks_by_priority(tasks) that takes a list of dictionaries (each with a "priority" key: "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW") and returns them sorted by priority.
