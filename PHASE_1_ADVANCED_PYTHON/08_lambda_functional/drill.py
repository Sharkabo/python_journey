# Drills - Lambda and Functional Programming
# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Create a lambda that adds 10 to a number


# Drill 2: Use map() to square all numbers in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


# Drill 3: Use filter() to get only positive numbers from [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]


# Drill 4: Use lambda with sorted() to sort ['apple', 'kiwi', 'banana'] by length


# Drill 5: Use map() to convert ['alice', 'bob'] to uppercase


# Drill 6: Use filter() to get students with grade >= 80 from a list of dicts


# Drill 7: Use sorted() with lambda to sort tuples by the second element


# Drill 8: Use reduce() to find the product of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


# Drill 9: Chain map and filter: double even numbers only from [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


# Drill 10: Rewrite a map/filter operation as a list comprehension
