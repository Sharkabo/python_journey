# Task: Build a Custom Data Iterator

Open `answer.py` in this folder and complete the following objectives:

## Goal 1: Create a Range Iterator Class
Create a class that:
- Implements `__iter__` and `__next__` methods
- Works like Python's range() function
- Properly raises StopIteration

## Goal 2: Create a Reverse Iterator
Create an iterator that:
- Iterates through a list in reverse order
- Uses the iterator protocol
- Can be used in for loops

## Goal 3: Test Your Iterators
Demonstrate:
- Using your iterators in for loops
- Manual iteration with next()
- Proper StopIteration handling

**Expected Output:**
```text
Range: 0 1 2 3 4
Reverse: 5 4 3 2 1
Iterator exhausted
```
