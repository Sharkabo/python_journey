# Drills - Muscle Memory Training
# Follow the instructions in the comments. Write your code directly below the comment.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Drill 1: Create a class-based context manager called PrintContext that prints "Entering context" when entering and "Exiting context" when exiting. Implement __enter__ and __exit__ methods.


# Drill 2: Use the @contextmanager decorator from contextlib to create a context manager called timer() that measures and prints how long code takes to execute.


# Drill 3: Create a context manager using @contextmanager that temporarily changes a global variable DEBUG from False to True, then restores it when done.


# Drill 4: Create a class-based context manager called FileWriter that opens a file for writing in __enter__ and closes it in __exit__. Make sure it handles exceptions properly.


# Drill 5: Use contextlib.suppress() to suppress a ZeroDivisionError when dividing 10 by 0. Print "No error raised" after the context manager.
