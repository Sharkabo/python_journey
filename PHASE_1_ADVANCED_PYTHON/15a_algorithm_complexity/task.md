# Task: Analyze Algorithm Complexity

Open `answer.py` in this folder and complete the following objectives:

## Goal 1: Create Functions with Different Complexities
Implement:
- O(1) - constant time function
- O(n) - linear time function
- O(n²) - quadratic time function
- O(log n) - logarithmic time function

## Goal 2: Measure and Compare Performance
Create code that:
- Times each function with different input sizes
- Shows how execution time grows
- Demonstrates Big O notation in practice

## Goal 3: Analyze Real Algorithms
Determine complexity of:
- Searching in a list
- Bubble sort
- Binary search
- Finding max in a list

**Expected Output:**
```text
O(1): 0.001s (size 100), 0.001s (size 10000)
O(n): 0.001s (size 100), 0.100s (size 10000)
O(n²): 0.010s (size 100), 100.0s (size 10000)
O(log n): 0.001s (size 100), 0.013s (size 10000)
```
