# Drills - Unit 14: File Writing
# ------------------------------

# Drill 1: Write `with open("log.txt", "w") as f:`


# Drill 2: Inside the block, write "Log Entry 1" using f.write()


# Drill 3: Run it again but with "Log Entry 2". Does it overwrite? (Yes)


# Drill 4: Change "w" to "a" (append mode)


# Drill 5: Write "Log Entry 3" in append mode and see if it adds to the end
