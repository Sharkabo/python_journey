# Python Journey

## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and progress tracker for learning Python. It documents my journey from zero coding basis to mastering Python concepts through a specific **"Spiral Learning"** method.

## Structure
The learning process is organized into sequential units. Each unit exists in its own folder and follows a strict "Four-Part Structure":

1.  **Concept** (`concept.md`): A concise explanation of the unit's core topic (The "Why" and "How").
2.  **Drill** (`drill.py`): A set of exercises to practice the concept.
3.  **Task** (`task.md`): A practical challenge based on the concept to test understanding.
4.  **Answer** (`answer.py`): The workspace to write code and solve the task.

## Methodology
**Spiral Learning**: Concepts are introduced simply at first and then revisited in later units with increasing complexity. This ensures continuous reinforcement of knowledge.
