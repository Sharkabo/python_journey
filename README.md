## Learning System

### Multi-Phase Curriculum
This project uses a **7-phase learning system** from Python basics to production-ready FastAPI development:

1. **PHASE_0**: Python Basics (21 units) - Variables, loops, functions, OOP intro
2. **PHASE_1**: Advanced Python (16 units) - OOP, decorators, type hints, algorithms
3. **PHASE_2**: Web Fundamentals - HTTP, SQL, databases
4. **PHASE_3**: FastAPI Core - Routes, Pydantic, authentication, async
5. **PHASE_4**: DevOps & Deployment - Docker, CI/CD, GCP Cloud Run
6. **PHASE_5**: Advanced Skills - Redis, Celery, AI integration, testing
7. **PHASE_6**: Capstone Projects - Full-stack applications

### How Each Unit Works

Each unit directory contains:
- **concept.md** - Theory and explanations (with YouTube recommendations)
- **task.md** - Hands-on implementation tasks
- **drill.py** - Practice exercises for muscle memory
- **my_answer.py** - Your solution file

### Learning Method
1. Read `concept.md` to understand the concept
2. Watch recommended YouTube videos if needed
3. Complete `drill.py` exercises
4. Solve the `task.md` challenge
5. Write your solution in `my_answer.py`

---

## Side Projects Roadmap

Build **6 portfolio projects** while learning:

### Essential Projects (Must Build)
1. **Task Management API** (After PHASE_1) - Authentication, CRUD, REST principles
2. **E-commerce Product API** (After PHASE_3) - PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, production-ready
3. **Social Media API with AI** (After PHASE_5) - AI integration, WebSockets, deployed to cloud

### Advanced Projects (Highly Recommended)
4. **Real-time Chat API** - WebSockets, Redis Pub/Sub
5. **Multi-tenant SaaS API** - Payment integration, tenant isolation
6. **AI Code Review Bot** - GitHub integration, AI-powered analysis

**Full details**: See [SIDE_PROJECTS_ROADMAP.md](SIDE_PROJECTS_ROADMAP.md)
