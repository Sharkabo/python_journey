# Drills - Unit 12: Loop Control
# --------------------------------

# Drill 1: Write a for loop from 0 to 9, but break when i equals 7


# Drill 2: Write a for loop from 0 to 5, but continue (skip) when i equals 3


# Drill 3: Create a while True loop that asks for input and breaks if input is "stop"


# Drill 4: Loop through [10, 15, 20, 25, 30] and skip printing numbers less than 20 using continue


# Drill 5: Loop through range(10) and only print even numbers (use continue to skip odd numbers)
