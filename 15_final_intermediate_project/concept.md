# Unit 15: Intermediate Final Project

## 1. Challenge: The Journal
Combine everything you learned in the Intermediate block.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Loop** (Unit 10): Keep the program running until the user types "exit".
2.  **Input** (Unit 03): Ask the user to write a journal entry.
3.  **File Appending** (Unit 14): Save that entry to `journal.txt` using append mode (`"a"`).
4.  **Date** (Unit 11): (Optional) Add the current date to the entry.

## Spiral Learning Note
You can now create persistent applications! By combining Loops, Input, and Files, you have a real software application.
